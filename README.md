### Fibonacci Huge

For user-prompted input consisting of two long values, n and m, this algorithm calculates the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence modulo m.

### Fibonacci Sum Last Digit

For a user-prompted long value n, this algorithm evaluates the sum of the last digits of the first n terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

### Fibonacci Sum Last Digit 2

This algorithm is a more efficient version of FibonacciSumLastDigit that already has the Pisano period modulo 10 evaluated and stored as a constant integer array, thus eliminating the need for the getPisanoPeriod helper function.

### Fibonacci Partial Sum

This algorithm evaluates the sum of the last digits of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence from the nth to the mth term, where n and m are two non-negative integers. As with Fibonacci Sum Last Digit 2, the Pisano period modulo 10 is stored as a constant to eliminate the CPU-demanding helper function required to evaluate the Pisano period.
